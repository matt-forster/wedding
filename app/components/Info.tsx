        <h2>Sunday, September 5th, 2021</h2>
        <p>
          Dear Friends and family, We've decided to resend our invitations and
          reinvite everyone in hopes that it is possible to run some semblance
          of a gathering later next year. Of course, given the circumstances,
          plans might change - and we will update the information below and
          email you if that happens. We recognize that it will be a new year,
          under new circumstances, and understand if you are unable to come. We
          are still committed to providing an experience that everyone will
          cherish.
        </p>

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>

        <h3>Travel</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We recommend a flight to Nanimo (Vancouver Island)</li>
          <li>
            Renting a car in Nanimo to drive to Ucluelet is a great way to see
            some awesome landscape on Vancouver Island
          </li>
          <li>
            If you choose to drive through Vancouver, be aware of; ferry
            schedule changes, line ups, and rush hour traffic - all which can
            cause very long delays.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to bring</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Hiking boots! (or at least good shoes)</li>
          <li>Rain gear - coat at the least</li>
          <li>A camera - the scenery is incredible</li>
          <li>
            A game to play after supper! - We are not dancing, so instead we
            invite our guests to bring their favorite table top game.
